};
 let fruitsArray = jsonData.fruits;

for (let i = 0; i < fruitsArray.length; i++) {
  console.log(fruitsArray[i]);
}

for (let fruit of fruitsArray) {
  console.log(fruit);
}

for (let index in fruitsArray) {
  console.log(fruitsArray[index]);
}

fruitsArray.forEach(function(fruit) {
  console.log(fruit);
});
