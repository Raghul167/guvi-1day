1) Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

INTRODUCTION:
	HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It enables browsers to request and receive web pages, facilitating seamless sharing of information across the internet.

VERSIONS OF HTTP:
	1) HTTP 0.9
	2) HTTP 1.0
	3) HTTP 1.1
	4) HTTP 2.0
	5) HTTP 3.0

KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP 1.1 & HTTP 2.0:

Multiplexing: HTTP/1.1 can only handle one request at a time, while HTTP/2.0 allows multiple requests and responses to be sent concurrently. This speeds up page loading times.

Header Compression: HTTP/2.0 compresses header data, reducing the amount of information that needs to be sent between the client and server. This leads to faster data transfer.

Binary Format: HTTP/1.1 uses a text-based format, which can be inefficient. HTTP/2.0 uses a binary format that is more compact and easily parsed by machines.

Prioritization: HTTP/2.0 allows for requests to be prioritized, meaning the client can specify which resources are more important. This ensures critical content is delivered first, enhancing user experience.

2)Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in java script?

OBJECTS:
In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is a string (or a Symbol, introduced in ES6) and each value can be any data type, including other objects or functions. This makes objects a powerful tool for grouping related data and behavior.

SYNTAX OF OBJECT:
object={property1:value1,property2:value2.....propertyN:valueN}  

3)Codekata practice is done.

4)Completed the reading of IP ADDRESS ,MAC,PORTS and HTTP Methods.
